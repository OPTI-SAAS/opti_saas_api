# Implementation Plan: Client Management

**Branch**: `003-client-management` | **Date**: 2026-03-04 | **Spec**: `/specs/003-client-management/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-client-management/spec.md`

## Summary

Introduce a full Client Management module supporting three mutually exclusive client types — particulier (individual), passage (walk-in), and professionnel (business) — stored in a single polymorphic table with a manual discriminator and CHECK constraint. Professional clients may have one convention (one-to-one) and multiple internal contacts (one-to-many), each modeled as separate entities. Open-schema medical records are stored as JSONB. The module exposes CRUD endpoints for clients, convention upsert/delete, and internal contact management, with ILIKE-based search, pagination, and an explicit `active` boolean for deactivation/reactivation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.7 (strict) on Node.js  
**Primary Dependencies**: NestJS 11, TypeORM 0.3.20, class-validator, class-transformer, Swagger  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (multi-schema tenancy, schema-per-tenant)  
**Testing**: Jest (unit + integration/e2e)  
**Target Platform**: Linux containerized API backend (Docker)  
**Project Type**: Multi-tenant REST web-service backend  
**Performance Goals**: Support up to 10,000 clients per tenant; list/search responses within standard API latency budgets  
**Constraints**: Tenant isolation hard invariant, transactional atomicity via `TenantRepositoryFactory.executeInTransaction()`, type immutability after creation, open-schema JSONB for medical records  
**Scale/Scope**: New feature module with 3 entities (ClClient, ClConvention, ClContactInterne), one controller, one service, one migration, ~10 REST endpoints

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Pre-Phase 0 Gate Review

- **I. Architecture & DDD**: PASS — new standalone bounded context in client features with controller/service/repository separation. No cross-module mutations.
- **II. Multi-Tenancy Isolation**: PASS — all data access scoped through `TenantRepositoryFactory.executeInTransaction()`. Entities auto-discovered in tenant schema. Migration uses `${schema}` interpolation.
- **III. Security by Default**: PASS — endpoints guarded with `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`, `@ApiBearerAuth`, `@TenantApiHeader()`. All input validated through DTO pipes before reaching service.
- **IV. Database & Data Consistency**: PASS — CHECK constraint on discriminator, UNIQUE on ICE, FK constraints on convention/contacts with CASCADE, migration-based schema changes, transactional operations.
- **V. TypeScript & Code Quality**: PASS — strict typing with const enums (`ExtractEnumTypes`), type guards for discriminated union, no `any` usage.
- **VI. Testing & Quality Gates**: PASS (planned) — unit tests for type guards and validation, integration tests for CRUD flows, edge cases (duplicate ICE, principal contact swap, type immutability).
- **VII. Observability & Operations**: PASS (planned) — structured logging for client creation/deactivation/reactivation events.
- **VIII. API Standards**: PASS — OpenAPI contract defined, standardized error envelope, pagination on list endpoint, explicit request/response DTOs.
- **IX. Domain Modeling & Flexible Data**: PASS — discriminator with CHECK constraint, type guards provided, JSONB for open-schema medical records with `DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb`, convention/contacts as separate tables per constitution mandate.

### Post-Phase 1 Re-Check

- **Status**: PASS (all principles satisfied)
- Design artifacts comply with all nine constitutional principles. No violations to justify.
- No unresolved `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` items remain in research.md.

**Structure Decision**: Follow the existing feature module pattern established by features 001 and 002. All client-scoped feature code lives under `src/apps/client/features/clients/`, shared entities under `libs/shared/src/entities/client/`, and enums under `libs/shared/src/enums/client/`. The module is registered in `src/apps/client/client.module.ts`.

## Complexity Tracking

> No constitution violations detected. All design decisions comply with the nine principles.
